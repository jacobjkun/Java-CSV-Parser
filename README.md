## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).

This java code is relient on the sqlite-jdbc-3.30.1.jar Which is included in the lib folder of this project

How to use:
First make sure that sqlite3 is installed from and the folder path C:\sqlite\db\ exists (this is where the program will create the db out of .csv file pased to it).
